# Design Document

## Overview

The EU Real Estate Portal is designed as a modern, scalable web application that serves as a comprehensive digital marketplace for European property transactions. The platform leverages advanced AI technology, cloud infrastructure, and modern web technologies to provide an integrated solution for property seekers, estate agents, landlords, and property developers across multiple European markets.

The system architecture follows a microservices approach with a React-based frontend, Node.js backend services, and cloud-native deployment on AWS. The platform emphasizes security, performance, multilingual support, and EU regulatory compliance while providing an intuitive user experience across all devices and languages.
